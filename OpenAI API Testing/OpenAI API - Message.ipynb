    "# Testing OpenAI API - Message\n",
    "\n",
    "In this file you will find all the parapeters you may need to send to the OpenAI API to get a response for **chat/completions**. To access, you will use `client.chat.completions.create()` and assign it to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you might need different parameters for transcriptions, translations, speech, embeddings, fine tuning or image generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compulsory\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`models`**: gpt-4 and dated model releases, gpt-4-1106-preview, gpt-4-vision-preview, gpt-4-32k and dated model releases, gpt-3.5-turbo and dated model releases, gpt-3.5-turbo-16k and dated model releases, fine-tuned versions of gpt-3.5-turbo. We will use `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106` in this explanation, since is up-to-date (Jan 10th, 2024) and is cheaper than GPT-4.\n",
    "1. **`messages`**: A list of messages in a particular structure. For example:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  `messages = [\n",
    "    {\"role\" : \"system\", \"content\" : system_message},\n",
    "    {\"role\" : \"user\", \"content\" : user_message}\n",
    "]`  \n",
    "\n",
    "So far, out call to the API will look like:  \n",
    "\n",
    "`response = client.chat.completions.create(\n",
    "    model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106\",\n",
    "    messages = messages\n",
    ")`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optional\n",
    "\n",
    "You can modify the output from the model using optional parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **frecuency_penalty**\n",
    "    - Type: number or `Null`\n",
    "    - Default: `0`\n",
    "    - A number between -2.0 and 2.0. If greater than 0, repetition of tokens will decrease\n",
    " \n",
    "1. **logit_bias**\n",
    "1. **logprobs**\n",
    "1. **top_logprobs**\n",
