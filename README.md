# Large Language Models with GPT & LangChain

Welcome to my repository where I demonstrate my expertise with OpenAI's GPT and LangChain, a programming framework designed for working with Generative AI.

This project is an exploration into the powerful capabilities of GPT via the OpenAI API, focusing on practical applications in programming and automation tasks. Alongside GPT, LangChain is utilized to enhance the development and interaction with AI-driven functionalities.

## Projects
- **Electric cars**: delegate to GPT the creation of python scripts to get insights from the electric car market
- **Financial Sentiment Analysis**: run sentiment analysis using Langchain Tools and Output Parser

## What Do I Cover

- **OpenAI API Integration**: Setting up an OpenAI developer account and integrating it with Workspace.
- **Chat with GPT**: Leveraging the chat functionality in the OpenAI API, both directly and enhanced with LangChain.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Techniques for crafting effective prompts that guide GPT to generate desired outputs.
- **Conversational AI**: Methods for maintaining a coherent and context-aware conversation with GPT.
- **Data Analysis with AI**: Ideas for integrating GPT into data analysis and data science workflows, including a case study on electric vehicle data from Washington state, USA.

## Sneak Peek

Below are some snippets of the work you'll find in this repository:

- Installation of the LangChain package.
- Code demonstrating API calls to OpenAI's GPT.
- Examples of simple prompt engineering and handling conversational contexts.
- Insights into how GPT can be a part of a data analysis process.

Join me in this journey as we push the boundaries of what's possible with today's AI technologies!
