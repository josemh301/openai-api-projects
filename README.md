# Large Language Models with OpenAI API & LangChain

Welcome to my repository where I demonstrate my expertise with OpenAI's GPT and LangChain, a programming framework designed for working with Generative AI.

This project is an exploration into the powerful capabilities of GPT via the OpenAI API, focusing on practical applications in programming and automation tasks. Alongside GPT, LangChain is utilized to enhance the development and interaction with AI-driven functionalities.

## Projects
- **Electric cars**: The project involves using GPT to create Python scripts that can analyze and provide insights into the electric car market. This could involve data scraping, processing, and analysis.
- **Financial Sentiment Analysis**: This project is likely to involve using Langchain's tools and an Output Parser to perform sentiment analysis on financial texts or news to gauge the market sentiment.
- **Video Processing AI**: The project aims to extract information from YouTube videos using OpenAI's Whisper for transcriptions, embeddings for semantic analysis or search, and Langchain for additional processing or querying capabilities.

## What Do I Cover

- **OpenAI API Integration**: Setting up an OpenAI developer account and integrating it with Workspace.
- **Chat with GPT**: Leveraging the chat functionality in the OpenAI API, both directly and enhanced with LangChain.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Techniques for crafting effective prompts that guide GPT to generate desired outputs.
- **Conversational AI**: Methods for maintaining a coherent and context-aware conversation with GPT.
- **Data Analysis with AI**: Ideas for integrating GPT into data analysis and data science workflows, including a case study on electric vehicle data from Washington state, USA.

## Sneak Peek

Below are some snippets of the work you'll find in this repository:

- Installation of the LangChain package.
- Code demonstrating API calls to OpenAI's GPT.
- Examples of simple prompt engineering and handling conversational contexts.
- Insights into how GPT can be a part of a data analysis process.
