# Large Language Models with OpenAI API & LangChain

Welcome to my repository where I demonstrate my expertise with OpenAI's API and its different integrations with other tools, such as LangChain or Pipecone. This repository is an exploration into the powerful capabilities the OpenAI API, focusing on practical applications in programming and automation tasks.

## Projects
### Langchain
- **Electric Vehicles Market**: The project involves using GPT to create Python scripts that can analyze and provide insights into the electric car market. This could involve data scraping, processing, and analysis.
- **Financial Sentiment Analysis**: This project is likely to involve using Langchain's tools and an Output Parser to perform sentiment analysis on financial texts or news to gauge the market sentiment.
- **Video Processing AI**: The project aims to extract information from YouTube videos using OpenAI's Whisper for transcriptions, embeddings for semantic analysis or search, and Langchain for additional processing or querying capabilities.
### Pipecone
- **Semantic Search**: Ouperform traditional keyword-based search 
- **RAG for movie data**: Developed a project that enhances a language model's factual response capabilities by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for searching and analyzing movie data.

## What Do I Cover

- **OpenAI API Integration**: Integrating the OpenAI API with other tools and external API, such as Pinecone.
- **Chat with GPT**: Leveraging the chat functionality in the OpenAI API, both directly and enhanced with LangChain.
- **Prompt Engineering**: High level techniques for crafting effective prompts that guide GPT to generate desired outputs.
- **Conversational AI**: Methods for maintaining a coherent and context-aware conversation with GPT.
- **Data Analysis with AI**: Ideas for integrating GPT into data analysis and data science workflows, including a case study on electric vehicles
- **NLP AI Applications**: Use the OpenAI API to perform natural language processing techniques, such us sentiment analysis, or Speech-to-text.
