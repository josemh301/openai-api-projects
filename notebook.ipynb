    "In Python, particularly when working with the pandas library, the `\"O\"` in the `describe` method is used to indicate that you want to include only the columns with object data types in the description. The object data type in pandas typically represents text or mixed types (text and numbers). Here's a breakdown of what this means:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pandas DataFrame**: When you're working with data in pandas, it's usually stored in a DataFrame. A DataFrame is like a table with rows and columns, where each column can have a different data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Types**: Each column in a DataFrame has a specific data type. Common data types include `int` for integers, `float` for floating-point numbers, `bool` for boolean values, and `object` for text or mixed types.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The `describe()` Method**: This method is used to generate descriptive statistics of the data in a DataFrame. By default, it includes only numeric columns (like `int` and `float`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Including Object Types**: By using `include=\"O\"` in `describe()`, you are specifically asking pandas to include columns with the `object` data type in the descriptive statistics. This will provide statistics like count, unique (number of unique values), top (most common value), and freq (frequency of the top value) for these text or mixed-type columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in your code `display(electric_cars.describe(include=\"O\"))`, you're asking pandas to display descriptive statistics for all the columns in the `electric_cars` DataFrame that are of object type. This can be particularly useful for understanding the distribution and common values in text-based columns."
